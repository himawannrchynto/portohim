As is known Internet of Things (IoT) platform is applied to the enhancement in smart factories productions, operations and maintenance. IoT based on oneM2M technology in smart factories developed by interconnecting things (physical and virtual) and evolving interoperable information and communication. The paper describes the implementation work of sensing environment values in smart factory. In order to support data reliability and interoperability in smart factory environment, author uses IoT device based oneM2M standard platform. The implementation can contribute to the field of manufacturing to be able to deliver products and services in low cost and efficiently",

        desc:"Joining The International Conference and Get Best Paper Winner Award, with a research title is an Analysis of Power Transformers Lifetime Using Health Index Transformer Method Based on Artificial Neural Networks Modeling. As is known, Transformers plays a big role in the distribution of electrical energy. One of the factors that determine the reliability level of the transformer is the life of the transformer. The more frequent a transformer is used, the less reliable it becomes and therefore causes its lifespan to shorten. The purpose of this research is to predict the age of a transformer based on the health index transformer calculation which is then modeled using artificial neural network. The results of this research are the values used as the parameters in transformer testing which are insulating oil, furan, and dissolved gas. One of the advantages of artificial neural network methods in predicting the ages of the transformer is a calculation error that can be minimized. From the result of the research, the transformer age prediction system can be used directly to determine the age of other transformers, both new and operating ones, with a low percentage of errors. Furthermore, the method can be used as an option in maintaining power transformers.",
