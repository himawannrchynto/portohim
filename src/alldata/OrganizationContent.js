As is known Internet of Things (IoT) platform is applied to the enhancement in smart factories productions, operations and maintenance. IoT based on oneM2M technology in smart factories developed by interconnecting things (physical and virtual) and evolving interoperable information and communication. The paper describes the implementation work of sensing environment values in smart factory. In order to support data reliability and interoperability in smart factory environment, author uses IoT device based oneM2M standard platform. The implementation can contribute to the field of manufacturing to be able to deliver products and services in low cost and efficiently",
